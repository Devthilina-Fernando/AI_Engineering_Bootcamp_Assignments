John: Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining on time. Let’s get started with the weekly status update for Project Alpha. Sarah, can you begin with the backend progress?

Sarah: Sure. This week, I completed the API for user authentication and added validation for empty input fields. I’m currently working on optimizing the database queries. I expect to finish that by tomorrow.

John: Great. Any blockers so far?

Sarah: No major blockers. Just waiting for final confirmation on the response format from the frontend team.

John: Noted. Alex, can you update us on the frontend side?

Alex: Yes. I integrated the login and signup screens with the backend APIs. I also fixed the UI issue related to empty rows in the dashboard table. Once Sarah finalizes the response format, I’ll adjust the error handling.

John: Sounds good. Priya, how’s testing going?

Priya: I tested the authentication flow and found two minor issues with error messages not displaying correctly. I’ve logged them in Jira under ticket QA-142. Overall, the build looks stable.

John: Thanks for logging those. Daniel, any feedback from a product perspective?

Daniel: From the product side, everything aligns well with the requirements. One small request: can we add a clearer message when no data is available instead of showing a blank screen?

Alex: Yes, that’s doable. I can add a placeholder message like “No data available” by today.

John: Perfect. Action items then:
